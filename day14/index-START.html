    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const copy = players;
    console.log({players}, {copy});

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    copy[2] = "cedric";

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    console.log({players}, {copy});

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const copy2 = players.slice();
    copy2[0] = "myPet";
    console.log({players}, {copy2});
    
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const copy3 = [].concat(players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy3 = [...players];
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    copy3[0] = "A rabbit";
    console.log({players}, {copy3});
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const capitain = person;
    capitain.age = 300;
    
    // and think we make a copy:
    console.log(person.age, capitain.age);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //const capitain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 30});
    const capitain2 = Object.assign({}, person);

    capitain2.age = 30;
    console.log(person.age, capitain2.age);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const capitain3 = {...capitain}
    capitain3.name  = "Teddy";
    capitain3.age   = 32;
    console.log(person.age, capitain3.age);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name : "Felix",
